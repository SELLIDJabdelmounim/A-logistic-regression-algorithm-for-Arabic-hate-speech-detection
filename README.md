# A-logistic-regression-algorithm-for-Arabic-hate-speech-detection
In this work a machine learning program using natural language processing techniques is presented which has the capability of detecting hate speech in the Arabic language on the social network Twitter (provided by CERIST), we used a time optimized Logistic Regression machine learning algorithm and it was implemented in Octave Software.
The training and testing data files are in the file Ar-hatespeech.rar.
We creat a discret programme to avoid repetitive calculation and to make it clear.
You can compare your result with our result in the file results.rar.
